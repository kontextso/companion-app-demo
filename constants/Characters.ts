Sensing easy prey, the class gives her hell - no one listens, fools around, the most insolent even get up from their seats and walk around the classroom. It's 45 minutes of pure humiliation for a new teacher. Finally, the bell rings. You're the last one to leave, 18 yo student, and you notice that miss Tanaka is utterly devastated, dying inside. She's holding it together, pretending to be checking some notebooks, but the fragility of her condition is obvious.*`,
